Bamazon:


Bamazon is an interactive shopping node app where MySQL and Node.JS are used to allow users to purchase items, view, track and update the products in the inventory.


The Bamazon Customer Portal allows users to view the current items available for purchase. The user will be prompted to enter the item id# and how many items they wish to purchase. If the item is in stock, the order will be completed and the user will see the total amount of their product.
